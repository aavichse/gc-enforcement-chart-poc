# gc-enforcement-chart-poc
The POC will demonstrate how the charts are  released  automatically when the chart code changes (by Dev) or when new image tags are published (DevOps).
## Goal
As a customer, I want the ability to install the HELM chart with one of the major versions: v49, v50, or v51. For example, the following command: ```helm install my-release my-org.github.io/my-chart --version ~v49.0.0```  will install the latest available version within the v49.0.0 series. If versions like v49.1.0, v49.2.0, and v49.3.0 exist, it will install v49.3.0.

## Requirements
1. The ```Chart.appVersion``` represents the image tag, which is tagged and aligned with the chartâ€™s major version.  For example, image v51.28483.1234 corresponds to chart releases in the v51.0.0 series.  
Here are examples of v49 and v51 releases:  
```
apiVersion: v2
name: gc-kube
description: Guardicore visibility and enforcement
version: 49.0.1
appVersion: v49.4335.123.4

apiVersion: v2
name: gc-kube
description: Guardicore visibility and enforcement
version: 49.0.2
appVersion: v49.4847.123.4

apiVersion: v2
name: gc-kube
description: Guardicore visibility and enforcement
version: 51.0.1
appVersion: v51.1111.222.1

apiVersion: v2
name: gc-kube
description: Guardicore visibility and enforcement
version: 51.0.2
appVersion: v51.3653.123.1
```

3. The chart will be hosted in GitHub.io and will use GitHub Actions
4. A corresponding HELM chart will be released Each time a new image build is published. For example, if image v51.9837.333.0 is released, a new chart version 51.0.3 will be created with appVersion v51.9837.333.0.   *(Note: see the releases  above)*
```
apiVersion: v2
name: gc-kube
description: Guardicore visibility and enforcement
version: 51.0.3
appVersion: v51.9837.333.0
```
5. If the HELM chart code itself is updated, a new version will also be released with the same appVersion. For example, if a new label is added to the v51 major version, the chart version will bump to v51.1.3 (from v51.0.3).
```
apiVersion: v2
name: gc-kube
description: Guardicore visibility and enforcement
version: 51.1.3
appVersion: v51.9837.333.0
```
7. **In summary**, bumping the chart versioning (*X.Y.Z*):  
    *X*: Major version  
    *Y*: Bumped when the HELM chart code is changed  
    *Z*: Bumped when updating artifacts (image tags)
